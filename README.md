# myCtest
Repository for learning and testing C/C++ code

Following experiments are provided:

- `args:` based on `three`. An exercise in passing commandline arguments into a C program.
- `daemon:` basic daemon template.
- `daemon2` based on `daemon` with `start` and `stop` commands added.
- `fc`: used for some random testing.
- `niam`: experiments with pointers.
- `three`: experiments with functions.
- `tiny`: smallest C-compliant code.
- `types`: experiments with various default variable types.

- Created a `Makefile` template that requires minimum changes when used for a different application.
